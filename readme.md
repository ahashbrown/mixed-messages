# Mixed Messages
## A Portfolio Project

As part of the Codecademy course for full-stack development, we are to create what is essentially a random message generator. I plan to make my own version that will spit out randomized goals to achieve in Old School Runescape. 

It will spit out 3 possible tasks, being skilling, money-making, or bossing. The script is simply run with Node.
